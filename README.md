# About gmusicapi-scripts

This is a fork of [TheBigMunch](https://github.com/thebigmunch)'s archived [google-music-scripts](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts), which stopped working at the end of 2018 because of incompatibilities with changes in [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi). 

TheBigMunch is now working on his own api [google-music](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music) and all the tools that surround it, be sure to check that out as well. His original repo of these scripts was archived and does not accept PR requests anymore, hence this fork. Starting with **0.6**, this library will be based on my modifications.

I'm maintaining these set of scripts for people who have uploaded their music collections using the original [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi) from Simon Weber, and would like to continue to do so (or until they want to switch to another API).

# Installation

To use these scripts, you need gmusicapi-wrapper 0.7.x, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Forceflow/gmusicapi-wrapper).
